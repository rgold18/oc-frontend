# OpenCAD Front-End Wireframe Project

The OpenCAD Front-End Wireframe Project is a foray into redesigning the front-end of the web application.

In short, this is a project with a lot of filler content that's meant to explore new design options and opportunities.

## Commit 6e3eeb1

06.21.2023 - This is the initial commit to the repository. It has the day's work in it:

- index.html is the sign-in page
- register.html is the registration page. This needs to be redone... registration should have been a modal popup on the index.
- admindash.html is the administrative dashboard. Incomplete at this time.
- profile.html is meant to be the individual user's profile page and settings. Blank because it hasn't been started.
